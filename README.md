 
# Additive Bayesian Nonparametric Spectrum Estimation via Signal Slicing and Transfer Learning

The ABNSE project introduces a novel spectral estimation method using Gaussian processes (GPs) and their Fourier transforms (FT). By segmenting signals and applying Bayesian inference, ABNSE effectively estimates the spectrum of stationary signals, handling incomplete and noisy data with high accuracy and robustness. This project utilizes Python and libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and,Seaborn.

## Features


- Effective handling of incomplete and noisy data.
- High accuracy and robustness in estimating the spectrum of stationary signals.
